# generator-twoblokes-static

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive.

```
$ npm install -g yo
```


To install generator-twoblokes-static from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-twoblokes-static
```


Finally, initiate the generator in a blank directory:

```
$ yo twoblokes-static
```


#### This generator will:

- Create appropriate directories & files into your empty directory
- Install Bourbon as our Sass mixin library
- Install Grunt dependencies (sass, minify css & js, imagemin, file watch)
