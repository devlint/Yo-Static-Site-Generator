# generator-twoblokes-static [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twoblokes/generator-twoblokes-static.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twoblokes/generator-twoblokes-static)

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive.

```
$ npm install -g yo
```



To install generator-twoblokes-static from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-twoblokes-static
```

Finally, initiate the generator in a blank directory:

```
$ yo twoblokes-static
```
